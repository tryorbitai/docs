## Introduction

****OrbitAI**** provides a complete ecosystem for creating, managing, and orchestrating intelligent agents that can collaborate to solve complex tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs), tools, and knowledge bases.

### What is **OrbitAI**?

****OrbitAI**** introduce **autonomous agents** that can work individually or as teams to accomplish sophisticated workflows. Rather than traditional single-turn AI interactions, **OrbitAI** enables persistent, purpose-oriented agents that can:

- **Reason and plan** complex multi-step solutions.
- **Collaborate** with other agents in coordinated workflows.
- **Learn and adapt** through persistent memory systems.
- **Use tools** to interact with external systems and APIs.
- **Access knowledge** through semantic search and retrieval systems.
- **Operate safely** with built-in guardrails and validation.

### How **OrbitAI** Works

The **OrbitAI** architecture is built around the concept of **Orbits** - coordinated teams of agents working together to execute tasks. Here's how the system operates:

1. **Agent Creation**: Define specialized agents with specific roles, purpose, and context.
2. **Task Definition**: Create structured tasks with clear objectives and expected outputs.  
3. **Orbit**: Combine agents and tasks into orchestrated workflows.
4. **Execution**: The system coordinates agent collaboration, tool usage, and task completion.
5. **Results**: Receive structured outputs with full execution context and metrics.

```swift
// Initialize **OrbitAI**
OrbitAI.configure()

// Create specialized agents
let recipeExtractor = Agent(
    role: "Recipe Extractor",
    purpose: "Extract recipe content from URLs",
    context: "Expert in web scraping and recipe data extraction",
    tools: ["webScraper", "urlFetcher"]
)

let recipeFormatter = Agent(
    role: "Recipe Formatter", 
    purpose: "Convert plain text recipes into concise markdown format",
    context: "Expert in recipe formatting and markdown syntax"
)

// Define tasks
let extractTask = Task(
    description: "Extract recipe from https://example.com/chocolate-chip-cookies",
    expectedOutput: "Plain text recipe with ingredients and instructions",
    agent: recipeExtractor
)

let formatTask = Task(
    description: "Convert the extracted plain text into a clean, concise markdown recipe", 
    expectedOutput: "Well-formatted markdown with sections for ingredients, instructions, prep time",
    agent: recipeFormatter
)

// Create and execute orbit
let orbit = try Orbit(
    agents: [recipeExtractor, recipeFormatter],
    tasks: [extractTask, formatTask], 
    process: .sequential
)

let results = try await orbit.start()
```

## Core Components

**OrbitAI**'s architecture consists of nine primary components that work together to create a powerful AI application platform:

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Orbits** | Orchestration engine that coordinates agent teams and task execution | Sequential/hierarchical processes, multi-agent coordination, execution management |
| **Agents** | Autonomous AI entities with specific roles and capabilities | Role-based behavior, tool integration, memory systems, delegation support |
| **Tasks** | Structured units of work with defined objectives and constraints | Flexible execution, dependency management, output formatting, validation |
| **LLMs** | Large Language Model providers and management system | Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), model selection, token management |
| **Tools** | External capabilities and integrations available to agents | File operations, web search, calculations, API integrations, system tools |
| **Process** | Execution strategies that determine how agents collaborate | Sequential (one-by-one) or hierarchical (manager-coordinated) workflows |
| **KnowledgeBase** | Semantic information storage and retrieval system | Document ingestion, embedding-based search, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) |
| **Memory** | Persistent storage for agent learning and context retention | Short-term, long-term, entity, and contextual memory types |
| **Guardrails** | Safety and validation framework for agent behavior | Content filtering, behavior constraints, output validation, compliance checks |

## System Integration

### How Components Work Together

The **OrbitAI** system creates powerful AI applications through seamless integration of its components:

#### 1. Initialization & Configuration
```swift
OrbitAI.configure()
let llmManager = LLMManager()
try llmManager.addProvider(OpenAIProvider(apiKey: "your-key"))
```

#### 2. Agent Creation & Specialization  
Agents are created with specific roles and equipped with relevant tools and LLM access:
```swift
let recipeExtractor = Agent(
    role: "Recipe Extractor",
    purpose: "Extract recipe content from URLs", 
    context: "Expert in web scraping and recipe data extraction",
    tools: ["webScraper", "urlFetcher"]
)
```

#### 3. Task Definition & Assignment
Tasks are created with clear objectives and can leverage all system components:
```swift
let extractTask = Task(
    description: "Extract recipe from https://example.com/chocolate-chip-cookies",
    expectedOutput: "Plain text recipe with ingredients and instructions",
    tools: ["webScraper", "urlFetcher"],
    agent: recipeExtractor
)
```

#### 4. Knowledge & Memory Integration
Agents can access shared knowledge bases and maintain persistent memory:
```swift
let knowledgeBase = KnowledgeBase()
try await knowledgeBase.addSource(DirectorySource(path: "/recipes"))

recipeExtractor.knowledgeBase = knowledgeBase
recipeExtractor.enableMemory(type: .longTerm)
```

#### 5. Orbit Orchestration  
The Orbit coordinates everything together:
```swift
let orbit = try Orbit(
    agents: [recipeExtractor],
    tasks: [extractTask],
    process: .sequential,
    memory: true,
    usageMetrics: true
)
```

#### 6. Execution Flow
During execution, components interact dynamically:

- **LLM Provider**: Agents use configured LLM providers for reasoning and text generation
- **Tool Integration**: Agents invoke tools as needed for task completion  
- **Memory Access**: Agents store and retrieve relevant information
- **Knowledge Query**: Agents search knowledge bases for additional context
- **Guardrail Checking**: All outputs are validated against configured guardrails
- **Task Coordination**: The process manages task dependencies and agent collaboration

#### 7. Result Integration
Final results combine outputs from all components:
```swift
let results = try await orbit.start()
// Results include:
// - Task outputs and agent contributions  
// - Memory updates and learning
// - Tool usage and external data
// - Knowledge base queries and context
// - Guardrail validation results
// - Performance metrics and usage data
```

### Key Integration Patterns

1. **Memory-Knowledge Synergy**: Agents combine personal memory with shared knowledge bases for comprehensive context

2. **Tool-LLM Integration**: LLM providers help agents select and use appropriate tools for task completion

3. **Guardrail-Validation Pipeline**: All agent outputs pass through guardrail validation before task completion

4. **Process-Agent Coordination**: Process types determine how agents communicate and coordinate work

5. **Task-Memory Feedback**: Completed tasks contribute to agent memory for future improvement

This integrated architecture enables **OrbitAI** to handle complex, multi-step workflows while maintaining safety, efficiency, and adaptability. The modular design allows developers to configure and extend the system for specific use cases while leveraging the full power of autonomous agent collaboration.
